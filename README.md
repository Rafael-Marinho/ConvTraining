# ConvTraining
This project has been made in purpose to simplify the process of Darknet / YOLO convolutional network training. Go ahead, it's open-source, copyleft and you must feel free to hack it at your desire.

#### You will need:
- Darknet and YOLOv4 (other versions must work too, I don't know);
- Python3 (Python2 must work too but it's dead since january 1st 2020, go ahead and bury it and go to Python3 once for all);
- Cmake;
- OpenCV (4.4 or higher);
